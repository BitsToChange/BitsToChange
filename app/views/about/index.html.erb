    <strong>Current online payment</strong> solutions are <strong>not</strong> as <strong>secure</strong> as we would
      like them to be.
    Currencies as we know them today were never created with the security considerations of the connected world we live
      in.
    <strong>Bitcoin is founded</strong> on the principles of <strong>security</strong> and freedom, shaping it to be the
      next major <strong>technological advancement</strong> since the internet and email.
    This <strong>new digital currency</strong> aims to be the safest, fastest and cheapest way of
      <strong>transacting online</strong>.
    For-profit business have begun to benefit greatly from <strong>Bitcoin</strong>, but so far there is
      <strong>no easy way for charities</strong> to get involved.
  </p>

  <p>
    You know that <strong>success</strong> as a charity means a <strong>low barrier to donation</strong> coupled with
      <strong>exposure</strong>.
    This is the charitable dream.
    We understand that this is no simple goal, but <strong>Bits To Change is here</strong> to help change that.
    We provide a <strong>Bitcoin donation hub</strong> where ease of <strong>donations and exposure</strong> meet in one
      place.
    Donors <strong>find the charities</strong> they already care about and new ones to <strong>support</strong>.
    Charities additionally benefit with donations and exposure from a <strong>new demographic</strong>.
    With this in mind we are making location and cause based <strong>searching</strong> our most prominent feature.
    Please join us in <strong>giving the change</strong> to those that <strong>make the change</strong>.
